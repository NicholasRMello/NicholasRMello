**`Aspiring Backend Developer | Java Enthusiast`**

I'm a programming student and tech enthusiast **at the beginning of my journey as a backend developer**, currently focused on learning Java. Although I had my first contact with the language about a year ago, it was only in the last few months that I truly committed to pursuing a career in technology. Since then, I’ve been building a strong foundation in programming logic, object-oriented concepts, and Linux server basics.

Right now, I’m exploring the Java ecosystem and applying my knowledge through practical projects that simulate real-world scenarios. I'm always open to learning new tools, collaborating on projects, and continuously improving as a developer.
